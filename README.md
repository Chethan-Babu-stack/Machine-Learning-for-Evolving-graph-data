Machine Learning for evolving graph data
==============================
Research is mostly restricted to static graphs, although most graphs change considerably over time.
We need to compute embeddings that encode the temporal information - but Representation Learning for temporal graphs is largely unexplored.

Goals:
1. Integration and research on foundations for temporal graphs and representation learning within GRADOOP
2. Build foundations of a graph streaming system that integrates methods for stream-based graph mining and learning
3. Investigate incremental graph mining and learning techniques such as graph sketches, incremental grouping, incremental representation learning and incremental frequent pattern mining
4. Application of graph stream analytics to be able to perform root cause analysis and anomaly detection
